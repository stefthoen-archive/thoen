<a href="https://www.codewars.com">Codewars</a> is a site that has code problems in all
kinds of languages. All problems include a set of tests, so it's easy to check
if you solved the problem. The best part is that once you've turned in your
    solution, you can look at the solutions of other people and perhaps learn a
    thing or two.
