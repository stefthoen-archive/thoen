Tom Cadwell of Riot Games gave this great talk about design patterns in
roguelikes and how they can be used in other game genres. I especially like his
list of roguelike design patterns:
* **Random Parallel Learning**: If a players learns different aspects of the
game in the order he desires he is more engaged.

* **Hero to Zero**: Having memorable high points with an expectation of failure
most of the times is generally a pretty favourable pattern.

* **Diverse Tools & Making Do**: By limiting tool availability to players they
learn to make due and be more creative and ultimately master more things and
engage with more content.

* **Competing Objectives & Strategic Commitment**: If you have competing
objectives you set up really interesting stratgic choices that are motivating
players.

* **Variety not Random**: Variety is superior to randomness. Randomness is just
a delivery vehicle.

But please watch the whole talk because it's quite insightful.
