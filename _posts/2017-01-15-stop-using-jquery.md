Like everybody else I immediately go to [Jquery](http://www.jquery.com) if I need to do something with JavaScript. For two reasons:
* It has a nice API that's arguably easier to use than vanilla JavaScript. 
* Browsers used to interpret JavaScript in a bunch of different ways and jQuery took care of these quirks.

The second reason is not an issue anymore because we don't have to support these older browsers. Should we keep using jQuery because of the first reason? I suppose not.

*Real* JavaScript developers write vanilla JavaScript. So dropping jQuery has been on my todo-list for a while. It's not that I think it'll particularly hard to write vanilla JavaScript. It's just that there's so much else to learn and do that I haven't quite found the time yet. That's changed with [JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com)!

JavaScript30 is a free JavaScript course by Wes Bos. It gives you 30 JavaScript challenges that you can do without frameworks, package managers and linters. I enjoy the simplicity of just writing HTML with some `<script>` tags and opening the file directly in the browser.

So far I've only completed the first lesson, but I look forward to the next one. We're building a clock apparently. Please let me know on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/baardbaard) if you'd like to join me in this challenge!
