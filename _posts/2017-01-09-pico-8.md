> [PICO-8](http://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php) is a fantasy console for making, 
> sharing and playing tiny games and other computer programs. When you turn it on, 
> the machine greets you with a shell for typing in Lua commands and provides 
> simple built-in tools for creating your own cartridges.

Cartridges are a special PNG format that uses part of the image file to store the game.
The console has certain self-imposed limits, like the 128x128 pixel screen size, or the
memory and processor. These limitations free you up to focus on developing the core
gameplay.

There's an in-console sprite, music, sfx and level editor. You can even write code
in the console itself, but you can also use your editor of choice. There's a big
and helpful community of PICO-8 developers and it's easy to share and try out
new games.
