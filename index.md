I have been a [musician](https://youtu.be/l9sm5M2BBkE) and a student of Computer Science and Philosophy. My wife and I drove around Europe for a year in an old [firetruck](http://joepdezoeperd.nl). We settled in [Morvan, France](https://www.google.com/maps/search/morvan++france/@47.1223364,3.691418,9z) and [build](https://www.paprikapatterns.com/building-home-choice/) [a](https://www.paprikapatterns.com/building-home-construction/) [yurt](https://www.paprikapatterns.com/building-home-mounting-yurt/) in which we lived until my daughter was born.

I sell [PDF sewing patterns](https://www.paprikapatterns.com) together with my wife. I [draw](http://joydestroyer.com), write about [Chess and Go](http://patzer.ch/ess) and [videogames](http://www.touchfuzzy.com).
